Some of these partners may use mobile device identifiers, such as Apple IDFAs and Google/Android Advertising IDs. Doing this allows the ad companies to recognize your computer or device each time they send you an online or mobile advertisement.

Sometimes, these identifiers may be derived from a hashed or encrypted version of personal information such as your email address.

In addition, sometimes we or an advertising partner may tailor advertising to you across different devices.</li>
