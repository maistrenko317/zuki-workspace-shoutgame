    <h2>General Terms and Conditions</h2>

    <h4>Program Overview</h4>

    <p>Welcome to Daily Millionaire. Daily Millionaire is a revolutionary, interactive experience where
        you answer trivia questions in a web browser on a desktop computer or on a mobile device
        during to win cash and prizes. Players attempt to win cash and prizes and by answering trivia
        questions quickly and correctly.</p>

    <h4>Affiliation</h4>

    <p>Apple Inc. and Google Inc. are in no way affiliated with or a sponsor of Daily Millionaire.</p>

    <h4>Eligibility</h4>

    <p>All players are eligible to participate in Daily Millionaire as long as they are not considered a
        minor by their country's jurisdiction. In the United States, a minor is considered to be a person
        younger than 18 years of age. The minority policy of other countries may vary. In order to
        participate in Daily Millionaire, you must signup with a valid email address and password or a
        valid Facebook login. An individual person may only have one Daily Millionaire account
        regardless of the number of email addresses an individual may own. In order to claim a prize
        Daily Millionaire may require additional personal information including, but not limited to full
        name, complete mailing address, date of birth, phone number and gender. Additionally, Daily
        Millionaire may require phone number validation, which will entail linking one valid phone
        number to a single Daily Millionaire account. A unique phone number may only be linked once
        to one Daily Millionaire account, and a Daily Millionaire account may only have one number
        attached to it. If we have reasonable belief that multiple Daily Millionaire accounts are registered
        to the same individual, or being played by the same person, we may suspend or terminate any
        duplicate Daily Millionaire accounts, and also suspend or terminate your participation in Daily
        Millionaire. In addition, only one individual person may be registered to a single Daily
        Millionaire account and only they are authorized to play a Daily Millionaire event signed into
        that account. Employees, and their immediate family members, of Millionaire or its associated
        partners, and any affiliates or subsidiaries are eligible to participate in Daily Millionaire but
        cannot receive any cash or prize(s). Employees of Daily Millionaire sponsors and their
        advertising agencies, and members of their immediate family are eligible to participate. The term
        "immediate family" includes spouses, siblings, parents, children, grandparents, and
        grandchildren, whether as "in-laws," or by current or past marriage(s), remarriage(s), adoption,
        co-habitation or other family extension, and any other persons residing at the same household
        whether or not related. Additionally, any former employee of Daily Millionaire or its partner
        companies is ineligible for a period of 12 months from their date of last employment.</p>

    <h4>Enrolling</h4>

    <p>To enroll in Daily Millionaire, go to the Daily Millionaire website and register for Daily
        Millionaire by providing a valid email address, choosing a unique user name and password, and
        providing other information we need in order to open your Daily Millionaire account. By
        enrolling in Daily Millionaire, you agree that you will keep your user name and password secure
        and confidential and keep your Daily Millionaire account information updated and accurate and
        that you will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Daily Millionaire account.
        We will deem any activity occurring through your Daily Millionaire account to be your actions,
        and you agree that we may rely upon such actions.</p>

    <h4>Game Structure</h4>

    <p>The Daily Millionaire game structure may vary from time to time at the Company's sole
        discretion. The "base case" game structure is a "bracket elimination" structure generally
        analogous to bracket structure of the annual NCAA March Madness™ tournament. But where
        the NCAA March Madness™ brackets pair 64 teams in head-to-head competition across 6
        bracket extensions, the Daily Millionaire Game platform can pair up to 1,048,576 players in
        head-to-head competitions across 20 bracket extensions. (Neither the NCAA nor any of its
        affiliates or member schools is a sponsor of Daily Millionaire—this comparison is used for
        descriptive purposes only.)
        The actual number of players can vary based on enrollment in each game. The minimum
        number of players is 128 per game; the maximum is 1,048,576. Payout amounts, expected profit
        and similar variables will automatically adjust to the total number of game players for each
        game. In each game, whether with 1,048,576 players or 128 players, the structure is always the
        same: head-to-head competition across the allotted number of brackets: 20 brackets for
        1,048,576 players, 7 brackets for 128 players, or anything in between, with each winner
        advancing to the next bracket, until a grand prize winner is declared.
        In the event an uneven number of contestants enter (i.e., a total number that is not an exponent of
        2), a bracket extension is filled to the extra number of contestants that exceeds a full bracket. In
        this case, then, the outermost bracket would not be completely filled, but the head-to-head
        contests would proceed nonetheless, with the first round effectively becoming a "play-in" round
        for the last entrants. There is, then, an incentive to register early for the game, to avoid landing
        in an outer "play-in" bracket and, effectively, needing to complete the first round of competition
        just to arrive at the main elimination bracket</p>

    <h4>Game Creation / Production</h4>

    <p>The Daily Millionaire Game platform supports simultaneous, multiple games targeted to
        different interest groups. This can be done because the Daily Millionaire Game platform is
        distributed, with Game Sponsors and their Producers given direct access and control over a
        unique backend dashboard, configurable directly by the Game Producer.
        The Game Producer will design the trivia questions to be used in each game, determine the level
        of difficulty that will apply to each bracket, set a game launch date and determine the additional
        configuration options, such as payout model, odds to win, etc.
        Part of the Game Production process is to prepare "Game Guides" - online resources from which
        all questions are drawn, and in which answers can be found. Fan sites may be an obvious
        possible source for a game guide. Game Guides might be provided to contestants for free, or
        might be charged for by the Game Producer for a small fee. Whether or not to charge for these
        items will be determined and optimized by each Game Producer, depending on his or her
        objectives, and those of the Game Sponsor. </p>

    <h4>Payout Configurations</h4>

    <p>The configuration of payouts for each game is an additional parameter of the Daily Millionaire
        Platform that can be modified on a game-by-game basis. Payout configurations determine how
        deep in the brackets the prize money is distributed. In the base case, assuming one million-odd
        players paying a $10 entry fee and a typical payout structure, payouts will be distributed as
        follows:</p>

    <p>This Base Case Payout Model pays 67% of the field at least some money, while keeping the
        primary focus on significant payouts ranging from $10,000 up to $1M as the key attraction of the
        game.</p>

    <p>There are multiple possible payout models configurable by the Content Producer. So, a Content
        Sponsor and Producer might decide to divide the Payout Model on a different structure, to pay
        into a larger, or smaller, number of bracket structures.</p>

    <h4>Odds of Winning</h4>

    <p>Because the Daily Millionaire Game platform is fully configurable so that Game Sponsors and
        Game Producers can select a Payout Model that according to the criteria determined by that
        particular Game Sponsor, the odds of winning a particular game vary as a function of: the
        number of brackets filled for each game, and the Payout Mode selected by the Game Producer or
        Game Sponsor. If the Game Sponsor selects the Base Case Payout Model, given 20 fully-filled
        brackets, your chance of winning something in the contest is approximately 67%.</p>
